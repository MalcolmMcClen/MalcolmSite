                <h1 style="text-align: center;" class="blue-text">Work Experience</h1>
                <p>Since 2015 I've had the privilege of working on rehab teams of varying sizes, as small as 5 and as large as 16 individual therapist across 3 different disciplines, primarily in short-term rehab/skilled nursing facilities, most of which are >130 beds in size. The most important skills I've developed as a result of working alongside such a wide-ranging number of people include:
                    <ul class="bullet">
                        <li>How to assist in the development and implementation of a plan of care for a specific patient.</li>
                        <li>How to solve problems and find answers without supervision or assistance from my more experienced colleagues.</li>
                        <li>When to ask for assistance and/or supervision from my more experienced colleagues and/or supervisors.</li>
                        <li>The most effective ways of ascertaining all of the most pertinent and objective results of a plan's implementation.</li>
                        <li>How to present those results to both professionals and layman alike, using industry-specific jargon and/or simplified terms.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>Additionally, I have some clinical experience working in outpatient clinics; I'm always open to an opportunity to learn new things!</p>

                <p>These experiences have made me a well-rounded team player, as well as capable solo therapist. These attributes have translated into me being a capable (albeit novice) developer as well; I'm very familiar with the process of identifying a problem and/or quantifying a goal, picking out the best tools and methods of reaching the aforementioned goals/solutions and executing a plan of action using those tools and methods; in other words Google and I are on a first name basis.
